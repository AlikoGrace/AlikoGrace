### 👋 About me

I’m a computer scientist working at the intersection of **LLM systems and security**.  
By day, I build language-model-powered systems.  
By night, I try to break them — carefully, creatively, and before bad actors do.

I grew up climbing trees in the upper parts of Ghana. My grandmother says that if I were born earlier, I would’ve seen elephants come drink at the stream near our house. 
These days, 
### 🧠 What I’m working on
- 🔐 Exploring LLM security, adversarial prompting, and model failure modes  
- 🧪 Experimenting with prompt-based attacks and defenses  
- ✍️ Writing as I learn — notes, breakdowns, and experiments  
- 🧱 Thinking like an attacker to build safer systems  

I believe LLMs shouldn’t introduce new vulnerabilities — they should help us **find and fix them**.
