### 👋 About me

I’m a computer scientist working at the intersection of **LLM systems and security**.  
By day, I build language-model-powered systems.  
By night, I try to break them — carefully, creatively, and before bad actors do.

I grew up climbing trees in the upper parts of Ghana. My grandmother says that if I were born earlier, I would’ve seen elephants come drink at the stream near our house. I’m still not sure if that’s folklore or history — but curiosity like that stuck with me.

These days, I’m obsessed with:
- finding weird edge cases in LLMs  
- prompt injection, jailbreaks, and adversarial behavior  
- understanding how models *actually* fail under real-world pressure  
- building defenses that make systems more resilient, not more fragile  

I believe LLMs shouldn’t introduce new vulnerabilities — they should help us **find and fix them**.
